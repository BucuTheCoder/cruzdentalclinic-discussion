      <h3 class="discussion-title">About The Project</h3>
      <p class="discussion-content">
        The project, titled "Web-Based Appointment and Patient Record Management System for Cruz Dental Clinic," is a capstone initiative aimed at modernizing the clinic's operations. 
        This system addresses the inefficiencies of their current appointment booking process, where patients have to call the receptionist to schedule visits. 
        By introducing an online booking system, the project streamlines appointment management, allowing patients to easily schedule appointments with their preferred dentist. 
        Additionally, the project aims to reduce the clinic's reliance on paper records by digitizing patient histories and procedures, ensuring that all records are securely stored and easily accessible. 
        This web-based solution not only improves the clinic's operational efficiency but also enhances the overall patient experience, making it easier for the clinic to manage appointments and maintain accurate records.
      </p>

      <h3 class="discussion-title">My Role</h3>
      <p class="discussion-content">
        In this project, I served as a full stack developer, contributing to both the user interface and backend development. 
        I utilized PHP and SQL to build and manage the backend, ensuring that the web application effectively handles and manipulates patient data. 
        My primary focus was on developing the appointment feature, which allows patients to book appointments online seamlessly. 
        This feature is central to the project's goal of improving the clinic's patient handling process, replacing the traditional phone-based booking system with a more efficient and user-friendly web-based solution.
